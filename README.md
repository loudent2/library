## Features

- **Book Catalog**

  - Search by title
  - Lookup by ISBN
  - Tracks multiple instances of each book via compound book IDs: `<isbn>.<uniqueId>`

- **User Accounts**

  - Fetch user by account number
  - Lists borrowed books (resolved via Activity service)

- **Activity Tracking**

  - Check-in and check-out of individual book instances
  - Resilient handling of partial failures with detailed per-book results

- **Observability**

  - Micrometer metrics for sync and async method execution
  - Log4j2 logging with per-request traceability

- **API Design**

  - OpenAPI 3.0-based interface-first development
  - Swagger annotations on models and interfaces
  - CompletableFuture-based async controllers

## Observability

  | Endpoint                  | Purpose                      |
  |---------------------------|------------------------------|
  | `/actuator/health`        | Health check for containers  |
  | `/actuator/info`          | Application info             |

## Technology Stack

- Java 17
- Spring Boot 3.4
- DynamoDB Enhanced Client
- OpenAPI Generator 7.x
- Micrometer + Log4j2
- JUnit 5 + Mockito
- Spotless (Google Java Format)
- Jib (for Docker image builds)
- Docker Compose (for local integration testing)

---


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 17
- Docker (for running DynamoDB locally or containerizing the app)

---

### Build the Application

Before running the service locally or in Docker, build the application and generate the OpenAPI sources:

```bash
./gradlew clean generateLibraryApi build
```

You should re-run `generateLibraryApi` whenever the OpenAPI spec (`spec/libraryservice.yml`) changes.

---

### Run Locally

Start only DynamoDB in Docker and run the app from your IDE or terminal:

```bash
docker compose up
```

Then in another terminal:

```bash
./gradlew bootRun --args='--spring.profiles.active=ide'
```

---

### OpenAPI Code Generation

This project uses interface-first development with OpenAPI 3.x.

Generate the Java API interfaces and models (if you didn't already do this during the build step):

```bash
./gradlew generateLibraryApi
```

To clean up generated sources:

```bash
./gradlew cleanOpenApiGenerated
```

---

### Build Docker Image

Build the Library Service Docker image locally using Jib (no Dockerfile needed):

```bash
./gradlew jibDockerBuild
```

---

### Run with Docker Compose

#### Run both the Library Service and DynamoDB:

```bash
docker compose --profile library up
```

The app will use the Docker bridge network and automatically connect to the DynamoDB container. By default, it runs with `--spring.profiles.active=dev`.

To stop:

```bash
docker compose down
```


## Design Principles

- **Interface-First APIs:** All endpoints are defined via OpenAPI and implemented manually.
- **Compound Book IDs:** Format `<isbn>.<uniqueId>` enables referencing specific book copies across the system.
- **Async & Resilience:** Activity operations are non-blocking and tolerate individual failures gracefully.
- **Clean Code:** 100% unit test coverage, Spotless formatting, strict warning flags.
- **Modern Builds:** Jib builds images directly from Gradle with no Dockerfile.
- **Environment-Aware Configuration:** Spring profiles separate local and container environments.

./gradlew test
```

## üî• Smoke Testing the API

You can verify the API behavior using a Python-based smoke test script that simulates user actions like checking out and checking in books.

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites

- Python 3 installed
- `pip3` available
- use 'make compose-up` to start a docker container.

### üß™ Setup

1. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```

3. **Run the smoke test script**:
   ```bash
   python smoketest/library_local_smoke_test.py
   ```

4. **Deactivate the environment** (optional):
   ```bash
   deactivate
   ```

---

### üîç What It Tests

The script runs the following scenario using user `ACC123456` and book copies from `"Clean Code"` (`ISBN: 9783333333333`):

- Verify initial user state and catalog availability
- Check out two books
- Confirm user now has books and catalog reflects the change
- Partially check in one book
- Fully check in the remaining book
- Confirm everything is back to the original state

Each API call prints:
- Status code
- JSON response
- `‚úÖ SUCCESS` or `‚ùå FAILURE`

The script exits with status `0` if all tests pass, or `1` if any fail ‚Äî suitable for CI usage.

### Example API Usage

With the service running (on port 8080 by default), try some basic API calls:

#### Get Book by ISBN
```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/catalog/isbn/9781111111111'
```

#### Get Book by Title
```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/catalog/title' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "title": "Sample Book"
}'
```

#### Get User by Account
```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/user/ACC123456'
```

#### Check out books
```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/activity/checkout' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
  "accountNumber": "ACC123456",
  "bookIds": [
    "9781234567890.1",
    "9781234567890.2",
    "9789876543210.1"
  ]
}'
```

#### Check in books
```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/activity/checkin' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
  "bookIds": [
    "9781234567890.1",
    "9781234567890.2",
    "9789876543210.1"
  ]
}'
```

#### Search the Catalog
```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/catalog/search' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
  "authorLastName": "Doe"
}'
```

## API Documentation

You can generate human-readable HTML documentation from the OpenAPI spec:

```bash
make docs
```
The output will be available in build/generated/library-docs/index.html.
